        "name": "Cobweb Model",
        "intro": "This economic model describes how changes in the price and quantity of a good on the market can lead to fluctuations instead of equilibrium. It is based on the assumption that producers make decisions about future output based on current prices, but do not take into account that prices may change. If supply and demand react with a delay, the market can fluctuate, forming a “spider's web” trajectory.",

        "name": "Adaptive expectations",
        "intro": "This model is used in economics to explain how people predict future values of economic indicators, such as price levels. It assumes that expectations about future prices are formed on the basis of previous data with gradual adjustments. If prices grow faster than expected, people begin to expect even higher growth in the future. This approach is used, for example, to analyze inflation.",

        "intro": "These are mathematical equations that describe how a quantity changes at discrete points in time. They are analogous to differential equations, but are used when time is not considered continuous, but as a set of separate points (for example, years or months). Such equations are widely used in economics, physics, and computer modeling to predict the development of systems.",
